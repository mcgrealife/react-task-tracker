Summary:
- Nested JSX like <Card><Avatar /></Card> will appear as Card component’s children prop.
- Props are read-only snapshots in time: every render receives a new version of props.
- You can’t change props. When you need interactivity, you’ll need to set state.
- In JSX, {cond ? <A /> : <B />} means “if cond, render <A />, otherwise <B />”.
- In JSX, {cond && <A />} means “if cond, render <A />, otherwise nothing”.


- State is immutable. cann't .push() onto state. would instead create new state and propogate it down.
